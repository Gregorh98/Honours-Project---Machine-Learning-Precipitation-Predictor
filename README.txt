All code here is as it was pulled from the Raspberry Pi on 13/4/2020. To see the system in action, please visit www.weather.ddns.net (Now Offline)

This project is 3 parts:
- The first step was the data collection step in which a data set was built up by collecting data on an interval from the sensors connected to the Arduino.
- The second step was to read the data set and build a classification model from it.
- The third step was to take the model and use it to make a prediction about incoming rainfall, displaying this on a web app.
